# Breast Cancer Classification using SVM

## Project Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the classification of breast tumors into malignant or benign categories using the Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm. The project covers various stages of a machine learning pipeline, including data exploration, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)). It consists of 569 samples with 30 feature variables each. These features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass, describing characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

## Steps Covered
1. **Problem Statement**: Understanding the objective of the project.
2. **Data Importing**: Loading necessary libraries and the dataset.
3. **Data Visualization**: Exploring data distributions and relationships through plots.
4. **Model Training**: Using the SVM algorithm to train the model on the dataset.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's accuracy and performance on test data.
6. **Model Improvement**: Suggestions and steps to improve the model's accuracy.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: The project is entirely written in Python.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing the SVM algorithm and other related machine learning operations.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using `pip`: '''pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn'''
3. Open the Jupyter notebook to view and run the project.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement other classification algorithms to compare performance.
- Deep dive into feature engineering for better accuracy.
- Use techniques like cross-validation for more robust model evaluation.
